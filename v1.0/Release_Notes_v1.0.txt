Release Notes v1.0
------------------

Tested with Arturia JUP-8000V v1.0.0.6114 (arm64)


Features:

- Runs on Win and Mac
- Support of .MID .SYX .PAT and .PFM formats
- Supports Single Patches / Performances as well as Patchbanks A, B, A+B and Performancebanks from both JP8000/JP8080
- STATUS field informs about the current status of the conversion process / errors / corrupted banks
- Logfile for each bank with all details about every single JP MIDI value â†’ JUP 8000V value.
- Curves are not converted linear but interpolated to match the exact behaviour of the Hardware
- Octave Shift / Part Transpose / FX Settings are generated as text into the comments section
- FX for Chorus, Flanger, Phaser and Delay are also converted, at least as close as possible (Sync is only converted for Delay)
- If 2 instances of Arturia JUP-8000V are used together in parallel the Patches will not run in SYNC.
  Workaround: In both instances go to MIDI Settings and assign a MIDI Controller to the LFO "Retrigger".
              In your DAW insert some empty space before your track and automate this button to ON and back to OFF.
	      This will sync the two instances.
- The LFO Fade knob will not affect the LFO PAN (just like on the hardware)
- Macro Controls 1+2 are used to retain the high resolution of the Fine Tune on Osc2 in Wide Mode
- Mono and Poly Modes with Glide supported
- Arpeggio is supported
- Patches are converted with sufficient headroom to avoid clipping (-24db)
- The volume of the dry Signal gets increased by 2db (-22db) when the Chorus / Flanger / Phaser goes from 0% to 50% to keep its volume constant 


Additional Notes:

MOD-X:
 In case OSC2 is Square and the PWM / PWM Depth gets increased the X-MOD on the JUP8000V behaves completly different. 
 Therefore the converter sets OSC2 PW from 50% to 52% and OSC2 PWM Depth from 0% to 12%. This keeps the Sound as close as possible to the original.
 The lowest value of X-MOD is always 0.025% (for some patches this is required to make the 2 OSCs work together)
 -> Once Arturia fixes this issue the converter can fully support the original settings.

Osc Common Envelope (Pitch Envelope) Decay:
  Decay has a bug - after value '65' the value gets reset to 0 and from there increases again.
  The converter adapts to this bug to make it work properly to not get any wrong Decay.
 -> Once Arturia fixes this issue the converter also needs to be updated.

JP 8000 FX:
 Currently JUP 8000V cannot convert any of the JP 8000 Effects because they have not been implemented by Arturia.
 So the converter uses the available Arturia effects to match as close as possible.
 Sync for FX is not converted, only for Delay.
 (On the JP 8000 all effects have sync since these are all implemented internally using 4 delay modules with just different Settings).
 -> Once Arturia supports the original JP 8000 effects unit the converter can also fully support them.

Velocity on OSC2 Range and OSC2 Fine:
 Would require an option for a separate velocity curves in advanced section, so it's not 100% accurate (the curve is already used by all other Velocity Sliders).
 This is mostly fine because usually it's used together with osc sync so the real pitch won't sound off.
 -> Once Arturia supports an option for separate velocity curves the converter can fully support it. 

OSC Shift / Part Transpose:
 Not supported by JUP8000V - See in Patch Comment and set octave / semi in DAW or play accordingly.
 Note: This is intentionally not emulated by changing the OSC1 Oct / OSC2 Coarse knob because
       then the Filter Keytrack behind would not match anymore.
 -> Once Arturia supports an Option for the Octave Switch / Part (Patch) Transpose which also takes
    the Filter Keytrack into Account the converter can fully support it. 

LFO FADE:
 For PAN LFO the converter does not use the GUI knob because it reacts to the LFO Fade.
 On the real JP 8000 the PAN LFO is not affected by the LFO Fade and is always running at trigger.
 So the converter uses Function1 in Advanced section to Control the PAN LFO for now to simulate that (to avoid FADE).
 -> Once Arturia fixes this issue the converter can fully support it via GUI.

Arp:
  Arpeggio Modes Up, Down, Up&Down, Random are converted, RPS is also set to Random.
  Arpeggio Beat Patterns 1/4, 1/6, 1/8, 1/12, 1/16 and 1/32 are converted, others are also set to 1/16.
